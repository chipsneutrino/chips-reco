##### WCSimAnalysis #####

Contains code for displaying, analysing, reconstructing, and classifying WC events.
Please see the github wiki for the complete description.

##### Input/Output #####

Input to code is WCSim ROOT classes, using WCSimRootGeom and WCSimRootEvent to build
instances of WCSimOutputTree.

##### Building the code #####

(1) Source the WCSim setup script e.g "setupWCSimUCL.sh" which sets up paths and ROOT

(2) Source the WCSimAnalysis setup script "setupWCSimAnalysis.sh"

(3) To build everything

make all
# (currently calls: rootcint, shared)
# does not force a make clean...

(4) To build in stages

# clean
make clean

# build root dependencies
make rootcint

# build shared library (lib/libWCSimAnalysis.so)
# (note: need to run make rootcint first)
make shared 

(5) To build the event display executable

make evDisp

###### Running the code #####

Running of the code except for the event display is done via ROOT macros which load
in the compiled libraries.
