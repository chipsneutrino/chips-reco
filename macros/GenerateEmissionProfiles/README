A set of scripts to generate emission profiles to be used for
the WCSimAnalysis fitter.

The concept is to run WCSim at a variety of energies and plot
the number of Cherenkov photons emitted as a function of angle
and distance that the particle has travelled, then appropriately
normalise this into the distributions that go into the fitter.

This requires several steps:

1. Generate the .mac files that tell WCSim how to run:
                  
                  . make_profile_files.sh
 
 1a) This script repeatedly calls calling generate_macfile.py
 1b) Use `python generate_macfile.py -h` to explain the arguments
 1c) make_profile_files.sh will repeatedly run the python script and
     step up the energy each time - you can edit the options in here
 1d) Make sure WCSim is saving the photon ntuple (and that WCSimTrackingAction
     has percentageOfCherenkovPhotonsToDraw = 100.0;

2. Run WCSim using each of these macfiles (use the batch!):
            
              for f in <the .sh files that were created>;
                do qsub -q medium ${f}
              done

3. Collect your output files and use them to make the photon distributions:

       <edit RunEmissionProfileGenerator.C to point to the new files> 
       root -b -q RunEmissionProfileGenerator.C

  3a) This will create a TChain for each energy
  3b) And then run a TSelector over it to create the emission profile histograms
  3c) These will all be packaged up in a single ROOT file whose name can be 
      set in RunEmissionProfileGenerator using myGenerator->SetSaveName("name.root");

4. Enjoy your new emission profiles!
