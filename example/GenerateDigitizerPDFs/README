A set of scripts etc... to make the DigitiserPDFs for use in the reconstruction.
These "likelihood maps" describe the probability of measuring a charge given a prediction.

Modify "MakeDigitizerPDFs.sh" to run what you need,
type=0 sk1pe
type=1 pmtSim
type=2 tot

You want them to be reasonably big, so that when the poisson takes over it is uncommon for this to happen

As I have not decided yet which method of normalisation is best. It spits out files that when hadded need
to be normalised using either normHorizontal.C or normVertical.C which need to be modifed to run correctly.

You can then put these files into the /config folder in the WCSimAnalysis directory

normHorizontal.C and normVertical.C are used to normalise the histograms either one of two ways,
they need modifying to run.

Combine.C and combine.py and used to collect all the files together and for the TOT put the two hists in the same file!
